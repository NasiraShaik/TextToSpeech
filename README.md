# Text-To-Speech

Text-to-Speech Converter with Tkinter GUI

_**Description:**_

The Text-to-Speech Converter project aims to create a user-friendly application that allows users to convert written text into speech. The application utilizes the Text-to-Speech (pyttsx3) module for the conversion process and integrates a graphical user interface (GUI) built with the tkinter library.

_**Features:**_

_*User Input:*_

The user can input any desired text into a multi-line text entry field provided by the GUI.

_*Conversion Button:*_

A "Speak" button triggers the conversion process when clicked.

_*Text-to-Speech Conversion:*_

The entered text is sent to the Text-to-Speech (pyttsx3) module for conversion into speech.

_*Sava Button:*_

The converted speech is saved as an MP3 file, and the default audio player is opened to play the generated speech.

_**Implementation:**_

The application is implemented in Python, leveraging the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech conversion.

The graphical user interface is created using the tkinter library, providing a simple and intuitive interface for users.

_*Usage:*_

1.Launch the application.

2.Enter the desired text into the text entry field.

3.Click the "Speak" button.

4.The application generates an MP3 file with the speech and opens the default audio player for playback.

_**Dependencies:**_

pyttsx3: The Google Text-to-Speech library for converting text to speech.

tkinter: The standard Python GUI library for creating the graphical user interface.
